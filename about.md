title: About Me
---

I am an industrial engineering student who is passionate about using technology to improve the world around us. In the past, I have enjoyed working on products that connect people and build meaningful relationships.

Currently, I am completing my final year and lead the You're Next Career Network at the University of Toronto. In addition, I am working on developing a mobile, technology-rich classroom for Defence Research and Development Canada.

Upon graduation, I aspire to be a great product manager, and look to apply my data, UX, and leadership abilities.

### Getting personal

I was born and raised in Toronto and am proud to call this city my home.

I spend most of my free time on [student organizations](http://gordontang.ca/cv/) or [projects](http://gordontang.ca/projects/). I focused much of my time in high school and university honing soft skills and building a better community, but have recently begun to partake in personal projects.

To unwind, I play sports, read, and cook (casually).

#### Athletics

I played competitive volleyball and badminton in high school, winning local championships and even the OFSAA/provincial volleyball championship one year.

Nowadays, I play intramural volleyball to stay fit during school, some ultimate frisbee, and dragon boat in the Toronto Dragon Boat Festival. I dabble recreationally in outdoor shinny hockey, ski and snowboard in the winter, and golf in the summer.

#### Reading

I enjoy non-fiction, business, biography, science fiction, and philosophical books.

I follow tech news (e.g. The Verge, TechCrunch) and drool over cool new hardware and software.
