Our team had some gaps in communication recently. Typically, our team is fairly quiet and with a busy spell, the team stopped responding and acknowledging messages. For example, I could not schedule meetings to work on our upcoming report and received no opinions or go-ahead on an email to the client.

During an impromptu work session, a teammate and I had a slight run in and we cleared the air of our expectations for each other (e.g. how much time and work should be done, what parts of the report needed to be completed and by whom).
