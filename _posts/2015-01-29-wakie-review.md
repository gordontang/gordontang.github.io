**What is Wakie?**

Wakie is a social alarm clock app powered by a friendly community of strangers who wake one another up in the morning. Rather than having your typical alarm clock wake you, a human being will call you.

Each call lasts 60 seconds, enough time for a nice chat to kickstart the Sleepy's day (Sleepy = the person being woken up). In case there is no one to call you when you want to wake up, Wakie's robot will call instead.

**Why I love it**

While Wakie has created a fun community environment, the app itself utilizes an understanding of human behaviour to effectively wake you up. By getting Sleepies to be more active when they are woken and further stimulating them with strangers, they are more likely to remain awake.

The Wakie team has been able to eliminate the major initial barriers to use such as providing a calling service and keeping users anonymous.

Although Wakie doesn't generate revenue yet, there are interesting opportunities as an advertising platform or adding premium features like longer calls, enabling users to connect after their Wakie call, or the ability to play sound effects or songs during a call. Marketers could target enthusiasts and utilize Wakie calls for promotions (e.g. winning tickets to a concert when you wake up).
