**What is Wakie?**

Wakie is a social alarm clock app powered by a friendly community of people who wake one another up in the morning. Rather than snoozing through your alarm clock, "Wakies" will call you (the "Sleepy") to get your day off to a good start.

On the other end, waking Sleepies seems like a strange behaviour, but enthusiastic Sleepies and curious users will find it to be a fun, mood-lifting, and rewarding experience. As a result, Wakies are likely to call multiple people in a session.

Each call lasts 60 seconds, enough time for a nice chat or quick song to kickstart the Sleepy's day. In case there is no one to call you when you want to wake up, you will still receive a wake up call, albeit automated.

**Why I love it**

The Wakie team has effectively utilized simple tools like phone calls and a communal message board to create a fun community environment. They have also been able to eliminate the major initial barriers such as providing a free calling service and protecting users' identities.

The app itself utilizes an understanding of human behaviour to effectively wake you up. By getting Sleepies to be more mentally active and engaged when they are woken, they are more likely to remain awake.

Although Wakie doesn't generate revenue yet, there are interesting monetization opportunities such as adding premium features or becoming an advertising platform. Premium users would like to be able to connect with the person they spoke to after their Wakie call or play sound effects or songs during a call to add more character. As an ad platform, marketers could target their enthusiasts and utilize Wakie calls for delivering promotions. Imagine waking up and winning tickets to a Taylor Swift concert!
