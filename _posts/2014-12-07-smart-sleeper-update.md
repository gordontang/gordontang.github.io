title: Smart Sleeper app update

Finally, the app can take a user's bed time and wake up time, and provide a calculated wake up time. Surprisingly, this was more difficult to do that I expected because of arithmetic with time values. Through my self-learning, I have also implemented tools such as bundles and fragments.

Looking forward to sharing the next update: Using an alarm clock API to set an alarm, or implementing an alarm clock that gets set.
